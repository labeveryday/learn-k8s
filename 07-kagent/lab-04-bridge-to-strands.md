# Lab 04 — Bridge: your Strands agents on your own platform

**Goal:** connect the agent framework you *already own* (`agents/`, the Strands template)
to the platform you just built — point it at your in-cluster vLLM, see MCP is the same
protocol on both sides, and decide *when* an agent should be a Strands process vs a kagent
object. By the end the two halves of "agents" in this repo stop being separate worlds.

**Time:** ~30 min · **Cost:** free (local kind) — no hosted API key

## The problem (why this exists)

You've now seen an agent two ways: as a **kagent object** (labs 01–03) and, in this repo's
`agents/` directory, as a **Strands process** — your real framework, with multi-model
support, an Agent Hub, Gemini media tools, and AgentCore deployment. The catch: `agents/`
has only ever talked to *hosted* APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Gemini). Meanwhile you
spent Phases 04–06 standing up your own model on your own cluster. Those two facts have
never met. This lab makes your framework run on your platform — the "sovereign agentic
stack" the Phase 07 README promised, actually wired together.

## What it bridges (two operational models, one idea)

kagent and Strands aren't competitors; they're two *operational models* for the same thing
(LLM + loop + tools). The lab's real lesson is knowing which to reach for:

| | Strands process (`agents/`) | kagent object (labs 01–03) |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | a Python program you run | a CR a controller reconciles |
| Lives as | a process (laptop, AgentCore) | a Pod the cluster keeps alive |
| Iterate / debug | edit + rerun, rich SDK, `print()` | `kubectl apply`, read conditions/logs |
| Tools | in-process functions **+ MCP** | MCP via `RemoteMCPServer` |
| Best for | dev, content pipelines, fast iteration, AgentCore | always-on, multi-tenant, observable, RBAC'd |

Same agent, different home. You pick based on *operational* needs, not on what the agent
*is*.

## Under the hood (MIT hat): the two bridges that make this trivial

The connection is almost free because two standards do the work:

1. **The model bridge is the OpenAI protocol.** vLLM serves `/v1` in OpenAI format
   (Phase 06). Strands' `OpenAIModel` takes `client_args` that flow straight to the OpenAI
   Python client — including `base_url`. kagent's `ModelConfig` takes `openAI.baseUrl`. So
   *both* front-ends point at the **same** endpoint with the **same** field; only the
   syntax differs. "Self-hosted" isn't a special mode — it's a base URL.
2. **The tool bridge is MCP.** Your `agents/examples/mcp_docs_agent.py` already loads tools
   from MCP servers over stdio; kagent's `RemoteMCPServer` is the same protocol over HTTP.
   The same MCP tool server can feed both.

```
   Strands process (agents/)          kagent Agent (Pod)
        │  OpenAIModel(base_url=…)          │  ModelConfig.openAI.baseUrl
        └──────────────┬───────────────────┘
                       ▼
            vLLM  /v1/chat/completions   ◄── one OpenAI endpoint, two clients
                       ▲
        both speak ────┘  MCP  (stdio in agents/, RemoteMCPServer in kagent)
```

Below all of it: the same Phase 03 stack — Service ClusterIP, kube-proxy, CoreDNS.

## 0. Prereqs

- The cluster from Phases 05–07 with **vLLM running** (Phase 06: Service `vllm` in
  `default`, serving `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`). Check: `kubectl get svc vllm`.
- The `agents/` template set up: `cd agents && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 1. Point your Strands template at your own vLLM

Expose the in-cluster model to your laptop, where the Strands process runs:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/vllm 8000:8000 &     # vLLM's OpenAI API now on localhost:8000
```

Now aim the template at it. This is the phase's first *code* edit — every prior lab was
`kubectl apply`; here you change two lines of Python. Open `agents/src/agent.py` and
replace the `MODEL = …` line (the file's designated "Model selection" customization point)
with exactly this block:

```python
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel

MODEL = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "EMPTY",                       # vLLM ignores it, but the OpenAI client
                                                  #   requires a non-empty string
        "base_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1",   # YOUR vLLM, not api.openai.com
    },
    model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",        # the model your vLLM actually serves
    params={"max_tokens": 256, "temperature": 0.7},
)
```

Why construct `OpenAIModel` inline here? The helper in `agents/src/models/models.py` has an
`openai_model()`, but it's the *one* provider that doesn't expose `base_url` — so the direct
constructor is the shortest correct path. (Optional, later: add a `vllm_model()` helper there
mirroring the others, so this lives in `models.py` like every other provider. Not needed to
finish this step.)

**See the symmetry — the kagent half is the same `base_url`.** Your in-cluster agents from
labs 01–03 point at the *exact same* vLLM through `ModelConfig` (`manifests/modelconfig-vllm.yaml`,
dissected field-by-field in lab-02). The load-bearing slice, next to the Python above:

```yaml
apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha2         # kagent CRD group (not core/apps) — installed by Helm in lab-01
kind: ModelConfig
metadata:
  name: vllm
  namespace: kagent
spec:
  provider: OpenAI                       # selects the PROTOCOL — kagent formats requests OpenAI-style
  model: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"    # == model_id in the Strands block above
  apiKeySecret: vllm-api-key             # kagent requires a key field even when vLLM ignores it
  apiKeySecretKey: api-key               #   (mirrors api_key:"EMPTY" on the Strands side)
  openAI:
    baseUrl: "http://vllm.default.svc.cluster.local:8000/v1"  # == client_args.base_url, but in-CLUSTER DNS
```

`client_args["base_url"]` (Strands) and `spec.openAI.baseUrl` (kagent) are *the same field
under two names*. The only real difference is the host: the Strands process runs on your laptop,
so it dials `localhost:8000` through the port-forward; the kagent Pod runs *inside* the cluster,
so it dials the Service's DNS name `vllm.default.svc.cluster.local:8000` directly (no port-forward —
Phase 03's CoreDNS + ClusterIP). Same endpoint, same protocol, two vantage points. That's the
bridge made literal — "self-hosted" really is just a base URL on both sides.

Run it and ask something:

```bash
cd agents
python src/agent.py
# > In one sentence, what is a Kubernetes Service?
```

**What to look for:** a normal answer — but no API key was used and no token left your
network. The exact same Strands framework, Hub, and hooks you'd use against Anthropic are
now driving *your* model. That's the bridge: your open-source agent, your self-hosted LLM.

> **Platform tie-in — OPTIONAL (the real payoff).** Point `base_url` at your Phase 06
> **gateway** (`http://localhost:8080/v1` after `kubectl -n kgateway-system port-forward
> svc/http 8080:80`) instead of vLLM directly, and your Strands agent inherits the gateway's
> token limits and prompt guards *for free* — it doesn't even know it's behind one. The
> route keys on `Host: llm.example.com` (that host and route come from **Phase 06 lab-02** —
> look back there), so set it via `client_args["default_headers"] = {"Host":
> "llm.example.com"}`. Your framework is now a *governed* client of your platform.

## 2. MCP is the same protocol on both sides

Open `agents/examples/mcp_docs_agent.py`. It builds an `MCPClient` over stdio, calls
`list_tools_sync()` to discover the server's tools, and hands them to the `Agent`:

```python
from mcp import stdio_client, StdioServerParameters
from strands.tools.mcp import MCPClient

strands_mcp_client = MCPClient(lambda: stdio_client(...))   # connect to an EXTERNAL MCP server
mcp_tools = strands_mcp_client.list_tools_sync()            # discover the tools it exposes
agent = Agent(model=MODEL, tools=[...] + mcp_tools)         # hand the discovered tools to the loop
```

That `MCPClient → list_tools_sync() → Agent(tools=…)` flow is *exactly* the role
`RemoteMCPServer` + `toolNames` played for kagent in lab-03. Side by side, the kagent slice
(`manifests/agent-with-tools.yaml`, dissected in lab-03):

```yaml
    tools:
      - type: McpServer
        mcpServer:
          apiGroup: kagent.dev          # the three fields below NAME the server to call (a structured ref,
          kind: RemoteMCPServer          #   not an inline tool) — == pointing MCPClient at a stdio_client
          name: kagent-tool-server       # the built-in server Helm created in lab-01
          toolNames:                      # the ALLOW-LIST — == choosing which list_tools_sync() tools
            - list_pods                   #   you pass into Agent(tools=…), but enforced by the controller
            - get_pod
            - list_events
```

Strands *discovers* tools at runtime and you choose which to pass in code; kagent *declares*
the allow-list in YAML and the controller enforces it. Same protocol (MCP), same decoupling —
the tool server is external to the agent in both. Run the Strands side to feel it:

```bash
python examples/mcp_docs_agent.py
# (it loads the Strands + AgentCore docs MCP servers over stdio)
```

**What to look for:** the agent gains tools from an *external* MCP server it didn't define
— the same decoupling lab-03 taught, just stdio instead of `RemoteMCPServer`. One protocol,
two consumers.

> **Optional, advanced:** the built-in `kagent-tool-server` is an MCP server too. Port-
> forward it and connect your *Strands* agent to it over streamable-HTTP MCP (the HTTP
> analog of the stdio client in `mcp_docs_agent.py` — see the Strands "MCP Tools" docs).
> Then your laptop Strands agent and your in-cluster kagent agents call the **same tool
> server**. That's the bridge at the tool layer, not just the model layer.

## 3. The decision: process or object?

You can now run an agent both ways against the same model and tools. Use the table at the
top to choose. The honest rule of thumb:

- **Reach for Strands (`agents/`)** while you're *building* — iterating on prompts/tools,
  generating content (your Gemini media tools), or shipping to **AgentCore**. The SDK and
  Hub make the inner loop fast.
- **Reach for kagent** when the agent must *run unattended* — always-on, multi-tenant,
  observable, restarted by a controller, RBAC-scoped tool access. The same agent, promoted
  to infrastructure.

## 4. (Optional) Run the Strands agent *on* the cluster — the DIY kagent

To see what kagent automates, containerize the Strands agent and run it as a plain
`Deployment` on LKE (Phase 09): a `Dockerfile` over `agents/`, env for `base_url`, a
Service. It works — but *you* now own the restart policy, the status, the scaling, the tool
RBAC. That's precisely the boilerplate kagent's `Agent`/`ModelConfig`/`RemoteMCPServer`
CRDs absorb. Doing it by hand once is the best argument for why kagent exists.

## Break it, then read the error (Kelsey lens)

With the Strands agent pointed at vLLM (Step 1), kill the port-forward and ask again:

```bash
kill %1 2>/dev/null          # stop the vLLM port-forward
# back in the agent: > what is a Pod?
```

**Read the error, that's the lesson.** The Strands process raises a *connection refused* /
APIConnectionError to `localhost:8000` — the framework is healthy, the **model endpoint**
is gone. This is the *exact same* "control plane fine, data plane unreachable" failure you
read as kagent conditions+logs in lab-02 — but now from the **client** side, as a Python
traceback. The skill transfers: identify *which boundary* failed. (If you used the gateway
tie-in, hammer it instead and watch your own agent get `429`s from your own token limit —
your framework, governed by your platform.) Restart the port-forward to recover.

## Checkpoint — you can now explain…

1. **Why connecting your framework to your platform was nearly free.** Two standards: the
   OpenAI protocol (one `base_url` for both Strands and kagent) and MCP (one tool protocol
   for both). "Self-hosted" is a base URL, not a special mode.
2. **When to run an agent as a Strands process vs a kagent object.** Process for building,
   content, AgentCore, fast iteration; object for always-on, observable, multi-tenant,
   RBAC'd. Same agent, operational choice.
3. **What you'd own if you ran the Strands agent on k8s by hand.** Restart, status,
   scaling, tool RBAC — exactly the boilerplate kagent's CRDs absorb.

You can now:
- [ ] Point any Strands `OpenAIModel` at a self-hosted vLLM via `client_args` `base_url`.
- [ ] Explain MCP as the shared tool layer between `agents/` and kagent.
- [ ] Choose process-vs-object for a given agent and justify it.

## What you proved across Phase 07

You ran an agent as a Kubernetes object (labs 01–03) *and* connected your own Strands
framework to the same model and tool layer (this lab) — proving "agent" is one idea with
two operational homes, both riding the platform you built: your model (Phase 06), your
gateway's policy (Phase 06), your cluster's machinery (Phase 03). That's a self-hosted
agentic platform on Akamai, end to end.

## Next

→ `lab-05-agent-harness.md`: now that the agent runs on your platform, engineer the
*harness* around it — the guides and sensors that turn "it runs" into "it's reliable," with
your gateway acting as a shared harness layer.
